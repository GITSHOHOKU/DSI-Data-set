# DSI-Data-set
DSI(Dam surface inspection) is a multi-class defects segmentation data set collected by a climbing robot on dam concrete surface. 
We have included the CSSC dataset in our dataset; to download CSSC dataset, please contact the authors of the [[Paper]](https://ericlyang.github.io/img/IROS2017/IROS2017.pdf#:~:text=This%20paper%20presents%20an%20automated%20approach%20using%20Unmanned,crack%20regions%20to%20assist%203D%20registration%20and%20visualization.). 


## Dataset Preview
We include CSSC dataset with crack and spalling defect in the left bottom of image. DSI dataset includes crack, patched area, erosion, spot, and climbing robot rope segmentation labels.

## link
We include augmentation of multi-class data, some of the augmentations containing fewer pixel labels than the original labeling are ignored by our txt files in zip files.
